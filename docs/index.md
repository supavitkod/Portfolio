## Brief profile

As a dedicated data analyst adept in Python, SQL, and Power BI (with DAX), I specialize in transforming complex data into actionable insights. With a Bachelor of Business Administration in Finance from Mahidol University International College, I've honed my analytical skills through diverse projects. Experienced in collaborating with cross-functional teams, I excel in communicating complex data to non-technical stakeholders. Eager for new challenges, I thrive in fast-paced environments, boasting strong problem-solving and organizational skills.
